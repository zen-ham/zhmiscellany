Introduction
===

Can be installed with `pip install zhmiscellany`

Currently, the package stands at 133 functions/classes/bindings across 14 modules.

The git repository for this package can be found [here](https://github.com/zen-ham/zhmiscellany). The docs also look nicer on github.

If you wish to reach out, you may add @z_h_ on Discord, or join [the server](https://discord.gg/ThBBAuueVJ).

Believe it or not this package is not a monolith, I've split off some functionality into a handful of other packages to keep zhmiscellany from becoming too bloated: [zhmiscellanygsudo](https://pypi.org/project/zhmiscellanygsudo/), [zhmiscellanyocr](https://pypi.org/project/zhmiscellanyocr/), [zhmiscellanyrusteffect](https://pypi.org/project/zhmiscellanyrusteffect/).

```

#

`zhmiscellany.discord.get_channel_messages()`
---

`get_channel_messages(user_token, channel_id, limit = 0, use_cache = True)`

Gets any amount of messages from a channel.\
Can also cache the data locally, so that it won't have to re download them when ran for a second time.

example:
```py
import zhmiscellany

last_1000_messages = zhmiscellany.discord.get_channel_messages(
    user_token=zhmiscellany.discord.get_local_discord_user()[0],
    channel_id='263894734190280704',
    limit=1000,
    use_cache=False
    )
```

#

`zhmiscellany.discord.get_local_discord_user()`
---

`zhmiscellany.discord.get_local_discord_user()`

Gets info about the local user, allows code to be run without needing to find your user token every time.\
So if the user is logged into discord on the app or in the browser (on windows) this function can return the data, which can really streamline things.

```py
import zhmiscellany

user_data = zhmiscellany.discord.get_local_discord_user()
user_token = user_data[0]
```

#

example:
```py
import zhmiscellany

guild_channels = zhmiscellany.discord.get_guild_channels(
    user_token=zhmiscellany.discord.get_local_discord_user()[0],
    guild_id='880697939016695850',
    use_cache=True
    )

```

#

    channel_id='263894734190280704',
    message_id='263894769158062082'
    )

content = message['content']

---

`zhmiscellany.discord.ids_to_message_url(channel_id, message_id, guild_id = None)`

example:
```py
import zhmiscellany

messagw_url = zhmiscellany.discord.ids_to_message_url(
    guild_id='880697939016695850',
